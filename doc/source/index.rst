Welcome to bruno_util's documentation!
======================================

A mini Python blog of sorts, this is a place for me to gather my thoughts on
changes that I feel should be made to Python, as well as common problems in data

The contents are subject to change when/if my hacks get merged upstream, but
until then, click on a topic you want to learn about!
